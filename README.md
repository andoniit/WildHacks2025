## Project Overview

**Purpose:**  
CycleConnect goes beyond traditional menstrual tracking by focusing on **building a support network**. Users not only track their periods, symptoms, and moods, but they can also share this information with selected friends, partners, or family members. The application facilitates open communication, understanding, and empathy around menstruation.

## Core Features

1. **Cycle Sharing**  
   - Users can share their menstrual cycle details (e.g., period dates, symptoms, mood) with selected contacts (e.g., partners, family members, or friends).  
   - **Example**: A partner receives notifications when PMS symptoms are expected, enabling better emotional support.

2. **Personalized Symptom Tracking**  
   - Users log physical and emotional symptoms (e.g., cramps, fatigue, anxiety) via simple checkboxes or sliders.  
   - The app provides AI-powered insights on patterns and symptom management suggestions.

3. **Community Support Groups**  
   - Anonymous groups based on shared experiences (e.g., endometriosis, PCOS, heavy bleeding).  
   - Users can share tips, ask questions, or provide encouragement in a safe space.

4. **Self-Care Recommendations**  
   - Automated tips for self-care, tailored to symptoms and cycle phase.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - "Try yoga or heat therapy for cramps."  
     - "Consider magnesium-rich foods for PMS."

5. **Educational Resources**  
   - Bite-sized guides on:  
     - Understanding hormonal changes during the cycle.  
     - Managing mood swings naturally.  
     - When to seek medical help for menstrual issues.

6. **Notifications for Partners/Supporters**  
   - Supporters receive notifications like:  
     - "Day 1 of the cycle: Offer extra care today."  
     - "PMS week: Encourage rest and hydration."

## Tech Stack Implementation

1. **Frontend (React)**  
   - Clean, user-friendly interface for logging symptoms, viewing cycle trends, and managing sharing preferences.

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**  
   - REST APIs to handle:  
     - User authentication and data storage.  
     - AI-generated insights using the Gemini AI API.  
     - Notifications for shared contacts.

3. **Database (MongoDB)**  
   - Stores user profiles (cycle data, symptoms, preferences), shared contacts, and community group posts/interactions.

4. **Gemini AI API**  
   - Analyzes symptom logs to provide actionable insights and recommendations.  
   - **Example**: If a user logs "severe cramps," the app suggests heat therapy or consulting a doctor.

## Workflow

1. A user logs into CycleConnect and sets up a profile with cycle details.  
2. They choose to share cycle updates with their partner and a close friend.  
3. During the luteal phase (PMS), the app sends a notification to the partner:  
   - "*Your partner may experience irritability or fatigue this week. Be supportive!*"  
4. The user logs symptoms like "mood swings" and "cramps."  
5. Gemini AI analyzes these symptoms and recommends:  
   - "*Try mindfulness exercises for mood swings.*"  
6. The user joins an anonymous support group, connecting with others who have similar experiences.
